## Ideas

Beelder is an app for team building in any area (eg. Tech, Music, Football, Home Renovation...) based on common interests or proximity. This app can be used for a phase which precedes the project organization phase (eg. Task, To-do list...) already present in many applications on the internet (eg. Trello).

Metaphorically speaking and referring to the Hackathon theme, we have provided a platform where each user can view and register to nearby hives on the map, in which a hive is a group of people who are forming a team in some area with a detailed list of necessary roles. This can be compared to the decentralized propagation of information that bees use among each others for indicating the position of the flowers by dancing, so that all nearby or interested bees receive the information. In addition to this, each user can receive a notification regarding the creation of a new hive nearby with similar interests. The user can also filter the hives based on his interests and, if he wants, he can join the hives by applying for a required role. Each hive will therefore have many users and a queen bee in which each user independently knows and performs a specific task just as each bee knows which function to do, like searching for nectar or pollen or feeding the larvae.

We have also introduced the possibility for each user to create a new hive becoming its queen bee: the hive can also not own a position on the map and be virtual, for example in those areas where a physical presence among team members is not required (eg. Design of an app).

We believe that the dualism of live events (present on the map) and virtual events will be very present in the future, given the period that has just passed, and will certainly be a solution to be adopted also for next year's Download Innovation, both in terms of the mix of live and virtual events and the use of the Beelder app to search for participants and form new teams for the Hackathon.
